Core ECS
=====================

Core ECS is a deterministic lightweight ECS framework.

It is heavily inspired in Entitas, but with some differences:

- Is deterministic (does not rely on hashtables)
- Does not need a code generator (no reflection, less problems)
- Easier to start using it
- No GC collections

Currently is in work in progress state.

This package will follow a [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

Any feedback is welcome !

Install
=====================

If you are using Unity, update the dependencies in the ```/Packages/manifest.json``` file in your project folder with:

```
	"com.judelco.core.ecs": "https://github.com/JuDelCo/CoreECS.git",
```

otherwise, use this package as it is in native C# applications, as it doesn't have dependencies with Unity.
